## The Weekend Concert Trip Generator
**“Bet you won’t go.”**

ConcertBet is a global travel decision engine that shows the **best concerts you can realistically travel to in the next 48–72 hours** — and helps you book the *entire weekend trip* around them.

This is not a concert calendar.
This is not a ticket site.
It is a **movement engine**.

ConcertBet answers one question:
> *What concert should I travel for this weekend — and how do I make it work?*
