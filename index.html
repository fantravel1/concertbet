Enter your location and budget, and we show you ranked trips you can actually pull off in 48&ndash;72 hours. No scrolling through calendars. Just decisions.</p>

                        <p>Within a 300km radius, you can typically pull off a same-day or one-night concert trip. ConcertBet filters every concert in your 300km zone, checks ticket availability, calculates drive or train time, and pairs each show with nearby nightlife and safe return options. This is the "quick strike" zone &mdash; you can see an amazing show and be back in your own bed without taking Monday off. Perfect for impulse decisions and spontaneous Friday night energy.</p>

We calculate the total cost (tickets + travel + hotel), time investment, venue reputation, the city's nightlife scene after the show, and crucially &mdash; whether you'll get another chance to see them nearby anytime soon. If the artist rarely tours your region, the venue is incredible, and the city has a great after-show scene, the answer is almost always yes. High score = worth it. Low score = wait for the next one.</p>
